%% How should the phase arrows be interpreted?
% The phase arrows show the relative phasing of two time series in
% question. This can also be interpreted as a lead/lag. How it should be
% interpreted is best illustrated by example:

figure('color',[1 1 1])
t=(1:200)'; 
X=sin(t);
Y=sin(t-1); %X leads Y.
xwt([t X],[t Y]); % phase arrows points south east

%%
% Phase arrows pointing
% *	right: in-phase
% * left: anti-phase
% * down: X leading Y by 90 degrees
% * up: Y leading X by 90 degrees

%%
% Note: interpreting the phase as a lead(/lag) should always be done with
% care. A lead of 90 degrees can also be interpreted as a lag of 270 degrees or a lag of
% 90 degrees relative to the anti-phase (opposite sign).
