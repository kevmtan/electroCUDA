ElectroCUDA – robust preprocessing & analysis for electrophysiology. Core features include noise-resistant signal processing, robust statistics & extensive hardware acceleration.

ElectroCUDA is intended for any multichannel field potential recordings (LFP/EEG/MEG), but development has focused on intracranial EEG (ECoG/sEEG) thus far.

Code is Matlab-based with calls to compiled CUDA, C/C++ & Fortran binaries. User-friendly wrappers abstract away all non-Matlab operations. Modular code & data structures facilitate easy interoperability with other packages. Compute performance is maximized via layered hardware acceleration & comprehensive code optimizations.
